    </header>
    <section id="about-text">
    <p>The “Patristic Text Archive” provides everyone interested with a collection of Late Antique Christian texts (i.e. “Patristic” is conceived in a very broad sense).  The archive starts off with Greek texts, but it is open to all languages, in which texts from Late Antique Christianity are transmitted. The archive is furthermore a place for translations of Patristic texts in all modern languages.</p>

<p>The archive starts off with only a few authors: First of all with Severian of Gabala<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:A-big-thank-you"><a href="#fn:A-big-thank-you">1</a></sup>, i.e. with digitised versions of the older, mostly Patrologia Graeca editions (new critical editions of the texts are prepared in the project “<a href="https://bibelexegese.bbaw.de/forschung-aktuell/editionen-in-arbeit/#c53">Critical editions of the homilies of Severian of Gabala</a>”), besides with the outcomes of the work done by <a href="http://www.athanasius.theologie.uni-erlangen.de/">Arbeitsstelle Athanasius Werke at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg</a>, i.e. Athanasius of Alexandria and the „Dokumente zur Geschichte des arianischen Streites“.</p>

<p>Exact bibliographic information on the edition used is to be found in the metadata section in the XML-files in the Github repository which are linked at the author pages as “XML-Source” (cf. for example the page of <a href="/posts/pta0100">Dokumente zur Geschichte des arianischen Streites</a>).</p>

<p>All texts are licensed by a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Licence</a> for use and re-use.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:The-relevant-lic"><a href="#fn:The-relevant-lic">2</a></sup> All texts are encoded as XML files and according to the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (in version P5) of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> following a <a href="/pages/encoding">schema</a> built upon the <a href="http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/">EpiDoc-Guidelines</a>. To ensure further interoperability all files follow the <a href="http://capitains.org">CapiTainS Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>To provide users with easy access to the texts (besides the repository), all texts are also available in a simple reading interface (thanks to the project <a href="https://github.com/Capitains/flask-capitains-nemo">Capitains Nemo</a>), which will be enhanced with more functionality as soon as possible. Links to the reader are given at the author pages as “Read Online” (cf. for example the page of <a href="/posts/pta0100">Dokumente zur Geschichte des arianischen Streites</a>).</p>

<p>As far as possible the texts are based on critical editions and are provided together with the textcritical information, but if that is not possible, older and/or non-critical editions are also provided.</p>

<p>The author pages (cf. for example the page of <a href="/posts/pta0001">Severian of Gabala</a>) show the quality of the editions provided for each text with the following badges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Critical edition (with textcritical apparatus): <img src="/images/edition-critical%20(with%20app)-brightgreen.svg" alt="Critical edition with app" /></li>
<li>Critical edition (without textcritical apparatus): <img src="/images/edition-critical%20(no%20app)-orange.svg" alt="Critical edition without app" /></li>
<li>Outdated critical edition: <img src="/images/edition-outdated--critical%20(with%20app)-orange.svg" alt="outdated critical edition" /></li>
<li>Pre-critical edition: <img src="/images/edition-pre-critical-red.svg" alt="pre-critical edition" /></li>
</ul>

<p>The editions in the archive can be enriched with further annotations (besides the textcritical annotations), for example encoding of biblical quotes, of places (with links to the <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades Gazetteer</a>, or of persons (with links to the <a href="https://lobid.org/gnd">Gemeinsame Normdatei [GND]</a>). Again, the author pages (cf. for example the page of <a href="/posts/pta0022">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>) show, which annotations are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Biblical quotations encoded: <img src="/images/encoded-biblical%20quotes-090A3B.svg" alt="Biblical quotations" /></li>
<li>Places encoded: <img src="/images/encoded-places-333577.svg" alt="Places encoded" /></li>
<li>Persons encoded: <img src="/images/encoded-persons-555794.svg" alt="Persons encoded" /></li>
</ul>
